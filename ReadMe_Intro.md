# ReadMe Goals
* Technical information surrounding the name, and version, of technologies used
* Explicit installation instructions
* Project aims
* Any relevant diagrams such as ERDs or UML diagrams
* A list of example routes and what information they expect to receive
* Please provide example data and the exact path of each implemented route
* Routes should be in a list organised by-route and not by request method (i.e. GET, POST)
* Further extensions that you would have liked to include (to provide context)
* While you should aim to test your app thoroughly, squashing any persistent bugs, the README should contain any additional quirks that a user should be made aware of
