# Meeting Notes

## Past Project Examples

- Instant Messenger (e.g. worm project)
- To-do List
- API Database (shop, art gallery)
- Game: e.g. tic tac toe, top trumps 

## Pros and Cons of Each
- Instant messaging: Seems a bit ambitious 
- Database: a bit more manageable 
- Art Gallery might be a way of doing this. 
- Also, a Zoo or animal shelter where people can 'adopt' animals
- How can we do the pricing functiton? 
- Ecommerce — might be impressive for clients

## Game
- It’s a lot harder. 
- Wordle-esque game
- Tic tac toe 
- Top trumps 
- Counting up to 21. 
- Count up in multiples of 4 is how you win :o  


## Quiz 
- Taliane and I still have some questions left over 
- ChatGPT question generator integration

## Todo list
- Patching different tasks with completed. 
- None of us were super enthused

## Conclusions
- We think either a basic game like tic tac toe or a database would be good
- Zoo, petting zoo/ cat cafe, animal rescue/shelter?
- Art Gallery, art portfolio website?
